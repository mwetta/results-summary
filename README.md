# Results summary component (Frontend Mentor challenge)

![Design preview for the Results summary component coding challenge](./design/desktop-preview.jpg)

## Description
I completed this frontend coding challenge to improve my understanding of grid, flex, and to generally practice my basic CSS skills. 

## Limitations
While I completed the challenge successfully for the desktop version, the design is not truly responsive and I did not implement a mobile version. In future projects, I will likely utilize a front-end framework.
